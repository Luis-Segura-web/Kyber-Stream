# Category Expansion Fix Verification

This document outlines the changes made to fix the category expansion issue in the Kyber Stream application.

## Problem Description
Categories were not displaying their content when selected. Users could click on category headers, but the content beneath would not expand to show the items within the category.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a disconnect between the ViewModels' local expansion state management and the SmartCategoryList component's state reading mechanism:

1. **Local State Management**: Each ViewModel (ChannelsViewModel, SeriesViewModel, MoviesViewModel) was managing its own local expansion state using local variables like `expansionState` maps.

2. **Global State Reading**: The SmartCategoryList component was trying to read expansion state from the GlobalCategoryStateManager.

3. **State Synchronization Gap**: When users toggled categories, the ViewModels updated their local state, but this wasn't being communicated to the GlobalCategoryStateManager, creating a disconnect.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChannelsViewModel Updates
- Added imports for GlobalCategoryStateManager, CategoryEvent, and ScreenType
- Modified `onCategoryToggled()` to call `GlobalCategoryStateManager.instance.handleEvent(CategoryEvent.ToggleCategory(categoryId, ScreenType.CHANNELS))`
- Modified `onFavoritesCategoryToggled()` to also update the global state
- Added category initialization in `loadInitialChannelsAndPreloadEpg()` to call `GlobalCategoryStateManager.instance.initializeCategories(ScreenType.CHANNELS, categoryList)`

### 2. SeriesViewModel Updates
- Added imports for GlobalCategoryStateManager, CategoryEvent, and ScreenType
- Modified `onCategoryToggled()` to call `GlobalCategoryStateManager.instance.handleEvent(CategoryEvent.ToggleCategory(categoryId, ScreenType.SERIES))`
- Added category initialization in `loadInitialData()` to call `GlobalCategoryStateManager.instance.initializeCategories(ScreenType.SERIES, categoryList)`

### 3. MoviesViewModel Updates
- Added imports for GlobalCategoryStateManager, CategoryEvent, and ScreenType
- Modified `onCategoryToggled()` to call `GlobalCategoryStateManager.instance.handleEvent(CategoryEvent.ToggleCategory(categoryId, ScreenType.MOVIES))`
- Added category initialization in `loadInitialData()` to call `GlobalCategoryStateManager.instance.initializeCategories(ScreenType.MOVIES, categoryList)`

### 4. SmartCategoryList Updates
- **Key Change**: Modified the `categoriesWithState` calculation to use the expansion state from CategoryData (which comes from ViewModels) instead of reading from GlobalCategoryStateManager
- Updated auto-scroll logic to work with the actual expansion state from categories instead of global state
- Preserved other state information (like iconType) from the global manager while using the actual expansion state

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
```kotlin
// SmartCategoryList was reading expansion state from global manager
val categoryStateData = categoryState.getCategoriesForScreen(screenType)[categoryData.categoryId]
    ?: CategoryState(...)
```

### After Fix
```kotlin
// SmartCategoryList now uses expansion state from CategoryData
val categoryStateData = CategoryState(
    id = categoryData.categoryId,
    name = categoryData.categoryName,
    isExpanded = categoryData.isExpanded, // Use actual state from ViewModel
    itemCount = categoryData.items.size,
    hasActiveContent = categoryData.items.any { ... },
    iconType = globalCategoryState?.iconType ?: CategoryIconType.FOLDER
)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Category Toggle**: When a user clicks on a category header, the category should expand to show its content
2. **Accordion Behavior**: Only one category should be expanded at a time (accordion-style behavior)
3. **Auto-scroll**: When a category expands, the list should automatically scroll to show the expanded category
4. **State Persistence**: The expansion state should be properly maintained across screen interactions
5. **Cross-screen Isolation**: Expansion states should be isolated per screen type (Channels, Movies, Series)

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. **Build the application**: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
2. **Launch the app** and navigate to any screen with categories (Channels, Movies, or Series)
3. **Click on a category header** - the category should expand and show its content
4. **Click on another category header** - the first category should collapse and the new one should expand
5. **Verify auto-scroll** - the list should scroll to keep the expanded category visible
6. **Test across screens** - expansion states should be independent between Channels, Movies, and Series screens

## Files Modified
- `app/src/main/java/com/kybers/play/ui/channels/ChannelsViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/kybers/play/ui/series/SeriesViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/kybers/play/ui/movies/MoviesViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/kybers/play/ui/components/SmartCategoryList.kt`

## Impact
This fix should resolve the issue where categories were not displaying their content when selected, providing users with the expected behavior when interacting with category lists throughout the application.
